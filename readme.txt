First of all, my app is kind of social network of football fans. you have 2 lists of favorites teams and leagues,
you can add whatever you want (name of team or league) and delete it, you can share your lists with 1 user.


How to use my app?
run "npm start", then go to: localhost:5000

I implemented it by using node js and express. the UI is simple html file with divs.
first screen(or div) is login. only register and login.
the second screen has few things together: the 2 lists (favorite teams, favorite leagues) and you can show and hide the lists,
you can add item to each list and delete items, you can clear the list and you have an option to share it with 1 user
(you should know his username in order to do so)
then you can click on the button to watch your "shared" profiles (the lists of the users that shared their profile
with you).
you can logout (by cookies).
